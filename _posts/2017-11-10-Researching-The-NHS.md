# Initial thoughts
Based on our games theme I wanted to reaserch areas into the NHS that included staffing, their budget and inefficency in the sytem as a whole to try and find anything we could turn into a game idea.

## Budget
I found out a few interesting facts about the NHS's budget.
For example, the average yearly growth of their budget over the years has been sat around 4% however in the last decade it has decreased to 1.1% [1].
Additionaly it is speculated that there are plans to cut the national health budget by 85 million pounds[2]. I also saw that there are plans to increas the NHS spending allowance by 8 billion pounds in the next 5 years however its said that this excludes areas of spending such as training and education for staff members[1].

I think it could be an interesting mechanic to put a hard limit on the ammount and availability of funds to the players in out game, this would add stress and mean that the players have to watch where their spending in order to be more successful. I plan to bring this up in the next play test session.

## Staff
There were lots of interesting stories with the NHS and staff, but I found these facts found in a survey taken by the royal college of nursing the most shocking.
The official guidlines say that nurses should attend to no more than 8 patients however it was found that 1 quater of them was tending to 14 or more. Also it was found that over a third of nurses state that essential patient care is being left undone due to a lack of time[3].

Tying into the money, I also thing limiting the players by restricting the ammount of staff and upping their cost would be a good place to start.

## Inefficency
Overall, 7.6 billion pounds is being wasted by the NHS just because of how they are spending. Many hospitals are overpaying for their reasources and I think this will fit into our game as we could have a range of buildings all at different costs, that all do essentialy the same thing. This would show players that if they trade with their peers and shop around, they could save money and build more just like with the real NHS.[4] I also found out that the NHS was losing 1 billion pounds a year due to fraud[5] which is a point I think i could raise to my group and see if we can do something with it.
