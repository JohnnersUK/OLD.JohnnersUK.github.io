# Dinky little dino
Dinky little dino is a simplistic infinite runner currently under development by Oscar Johnson (Me). You play as a blood fuelled dinosaur who must scale the mountainous terrain of the far east, smashing anything that gets in your way.

As of alpha build 0.1 the game has semi-feature terrain generation with a controllable character, along with a simple scoring system. The future roadmap looks as follows; <br>
- Complete the terrain generation system
- Implement obstacles such as spikes, ballistic missiles and Mothra
- Finish the character controller, adding kick and fireball attacks with animations
- Add civilians, buildings and other score increasing pickups

This project was coded in c++. The source code for this project can be found [Here (github)](https://github.com/JohnnersUK/Dinky-Little-Dino) and can be compiled in visual studio 2017 with the Windows SDK 10.0.16299.0.
