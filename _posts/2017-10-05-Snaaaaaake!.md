# Recreating Snake
Snake is a timeless classic, you know what else is a timeless classic? Metal gear solid
<br>And the name of the main character in metal gear? Solid Snake

Aaaaand that's about as far as this idea goes; I've been tasked with recreating snake in Huxtables Awesome Sauce game engine
with a few conditions, The game has to work (Obviously) and it needs to be significantly modified. So I have personally tasked myself with turning snake into a stealth based spy espionage game. Shouldn't be too hard... right? <br>_famous last words_

So the idea is that you play a normal game of snake, but in some AO compound, an each dot is a piece of intel.
A set amount of intel is required per mission and once collected you can exit through the escape route or continue
collecting intel for bigger score. As you play obviously your snake gets longer, making you easier to spot by the
patrolling eagles which will proceed to eat you once spotted. 

## Structure
Structuring the game should go as follows:
Class for the snake:
- Sub-class for the head
- Sub-class for the body

Class for the Eagles

Class for the pickups
- Sub-class for intel
- Sub-class for power ups?
