# Initial thoughts
Before these 2 play test sessions I had come up with 3 changes I wanted to introduce. 
- Have less fund cards in the deck to reduce availability
- Reduce the amount of staff and increase their overall price
- Have random building costs

# A change of pace
For test session 4 we decided as a group it would be a good idea to try something completely different. With the game pandemic already heavily inspiring us I drew out a set board. This time instead of building wards the players would be upgrading hospitals around the nation. Other than these small changes and the limits on staff movement, the game played very similarly, however we all decided it looked to visually like pandemic and that the gameplay differences didn't work with the theme nor added to the experience.

# Back to the old game then
## Reducing gold
My group agreed with me that funds needed to be changed but feared that removing fund cards wasn't the way to go. After a few play throughs though, we found funds was too plentiful and decided to remove half of the gold cards with the introduction of the wild cards. This way there technically wasn't less funds; however, players would have to decide if they wanted to lose a potential build card to fund another project.
## Reducing staff
Gone are the staff cards. With this change we bumped up the overall cost of staff to the maximum of 5, this way players could only buy staff if they have the highest valued funds card there is. 
## Random building costs
By coincidence Ricardo, one of our group members, brought in a game of hanabi that we could play around with. for those who don't know hanabi contains 5 colours of cards ranged 1-5, increasing in popularity as the numbers decreased. I sprung on this opportunity and so did fellow group members, to have randomized costs for buildings. This gives the players more choice in how to handle their cards, instead of just buying round after round.
## Introducing research
Tom's big idea this session was to introduce a global pool that the players could all feed into. After reaching a set milestone of funds, the players would unlock a bonus such as increasing the hand size. In the little testing we did this worked perfectly and will be fleshed out further in further iterations.
## Combining boards
Bryn suggested that we also combine all the boards as there was no need to have them as separate entities. Turns out he was right, there was no gameplay advantage to combining the boards, so we've decided to unify them into one mega board. Players start on each side and build out from their post, if they manage to join wards they can share doctors as an added advantage.

## Finishing up
With the fresh changes to our game I think it’s shaping up to be a good one, A few more tweaks and it's there. As it stands I personally don't think it’s difficult enough and want to change how the intake works but for now I'm not sure how. Increasing the number of the cards, or even having the players take in patients each turn, we'll see.
