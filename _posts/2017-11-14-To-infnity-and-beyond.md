# Creating my first infinite runner
So the follow up to snake is now to create an infinite runner with procedural generation. <br> 
As an ode to google and their oh so famous web browser, I'm going to base mine around their very own infinite dinosaur runner with added functionality.

# Breakdown
The player will control a Godzilla-esque dinosaur running infinitely towards the left of the screen. They will have to avoid obstacles such as road spikes, air strikes and other anti-Godzilla weaponry.

The player will be awarded points for squashing civilians and smashing buildings as well as burning the enemy moth who will occasionally swoop down in an attempt to hit the player.

## Procedural generation
The procedural generation will come in the form of several set pieces, sequences of obstacles that vary in difficulty. The game will then attach strings of these set pieces together according to the difficulty level of the game.

## Score board
Unlike duck game, this game needs to have a high score table that exports to an external file, reading n from tis file when the game starts.

## Art assets
As usual I'll be ripping sprites from the internet because I'm not an artist and I don't have time for that.
