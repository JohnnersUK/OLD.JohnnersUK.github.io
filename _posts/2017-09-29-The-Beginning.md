Git is a pain in the ass to use but alas here is my first post!

I think im finally getting the hang of this whole clone, pull, add, push, repeat malarky.
Just don't ask me how to fix anything if it breaks.

Found a useful guide online that underlines the [basics of Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) as well as a [markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)
that should be all I need for making basic posts.

I already have a basic understanding of how html and CSS work from my days as a BTEC student 
so i'm going to try and break this site down and make it my own as well as getting rid of that annoting slide in effect 
that plagues the post screen
