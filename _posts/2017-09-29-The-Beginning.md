### Git is a pain in the ass to use but alas here is my first post!
I think I'm finally getting the hang of this whole add, commit, push malarkey.
Just don't ask me how to fix anything if it breaks.

Found a useful guide online that underlines the [basics of Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) as well as a [markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)
that should be all I need for making basic posts.

I already have a basic understanding of how html and CSS work from my days as a BTEC student
so I'm going to try and break this site down and make it my own as well as getting rid of that annoying slide in effect that plagues the post screen.

Expect more posts soon, I've been tasked with making a presentation about static memory allocation
with my peers so I'll report on my findings as well as the final slides.
