# Dinky little dino
Dinky little dino is a simplistic infinite runner cyrrently under development by Oscar johnson (Me). You play as a blood fuled dinosaur who must scale the mountinous terrain of the far east, smashing anything that gets in your way. Available for download soon, players gain score by surviving the furthest as well as smashing civilians, buildings and other obstacles.

As of alpha build 0.1 the game has semi-feature terrain generation with a controllable character, along with a simple scoring system. The future roadmap looks as follows; <br>
- Complete the terrain generation system
- Implement obstacles such as spikes, balistic missiles and mothra
- Finish the character controller, adding kick and fireball attacks with animations 
- Add civilians, buildings and other score increasing pickups
