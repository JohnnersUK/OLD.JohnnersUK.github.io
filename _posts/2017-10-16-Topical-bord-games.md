# The assignment
So after spending two weeks adapting the popular table top games "Naughts and crosses" and "Ludo" we 
have finally been given our assignment breif which is, to no surpise to us all, to create a board game in teams of 4-5.

As a team we already had some ideas, as we all saw this assignment comming, however we've had to scrap them
as the assignment has some criteria that shattered all of our hopes and dreams.

The assignment breif is as follows
- The board game must be 2 or 4 player
- A game must last 30-60 minutes
- Must be based around a recent and topical social, enviornmental or politiacal event

We must also develop a log (this) tracking our progress, create a presentation of our early ideas (Ungraded)
and a final presentation summarising our game which will be graded. The board game will be play teste by our lecturers
on the hand in date so they can grade the game itself and they also expect us to have full proof of itterative
design with mutiple play test sessions with different people.

## Getting topical
All pretty standard stuff, apart from the topical event which is the curve ball that ruined our original plan but hey ho,
so here is a list of recent on-goings that I could think of:

- Brexit
- Trump
- Climate change (Inc. the currnet natural disasters)
- AI (Self driving cars, machine learning etc...)
- Conflict in the middle east (Inc. terrorism)
- Conflict in north korea
- Net nutrality (More of an american thing)

I'm sure theres lots more that im missing but being blatantly honest with you, I dont really watch the news as much
as I should. And as a class we've voted against using trump as a theme because its a dead meme at this point.

## First draft
I really wanted to do something with the rise of AI and machine learning, some terminator style game
that plays like risk or XCOM however im not really sure how closely that would tie in, being completely sci-fi
so I'm going with conflict in the middle east, specifically terrorism, as my idea.
Although overplayed in video gaming im not sure how well the topic has been covered in physical games,
all the ones I've played seem to be fantasy based, so i think it might be something fresh.

The Idea was to have a game that was almost a cross between pandemic and cluedo where 2 teams,
one terrorist and the other counter terrorist, race to complete and objective before the other;
Either ending in world wide panic or a lockdown on global security.

The game will be played on a board (Probably modeled after europe and the middle east) and will
be full of set locations that provide bonuses and reasources, which can be captured by either team. 
the baord will be acompanied by 2 decks of cards, one for the terrorists, and one for the counter 
terrorists and will contain useful tools, bonuses or even negatives that each team can use.

The goal of the terrorists would be to raise a panic meter, lets say to 10. To do so
they must gather reasources that enable them to run terror attacks, cards drawn from their deck,
which will raise the meter by specific ammounts depending on how big the event is (Costing more reasources).
The goal of the counter terrorists is to stop as many terror attacks as possible, find where the terrorist HQ is
and then take them out for good in one last offence. Each terror attack succesfuly stoped earns them a clue
which will allow them to guess the location and send their strike team.

Im not sure how the rest will work, some play testing will be needed, and it needs some ork on the finer mechanics
such as how to take locations on the map and what certain locations do for/against certain terror attacks. 
But for now its a solid idea that I don't want to develop any further incase my team dosne't like the idea or
comes up with a better one in the following week.
