# A very spacey place indeed
Keeping this brief, I've been tasked with making a prototype/set piece showcase for an upcoming sci-fi game. <br>
The game is to take place in a crashing spacecraft, users will have 5 minutes to overcome 3 obstacles and escape certain doom or else die.
2 of the obstacles must be escape routes that turn out to fail, I've planned my first one to be the escape pods (all will be gone apart from one which will malfunction)
and the second will be getting to the hangar, only to find all the small fighters destroyed. The final obstacle will be 3 small puzzles in order to unlock freedom, I plan my puzzles to be based around fixing the engines for the ship, so they can fly away.

Along the way the player will gain the ability to double jump (I’m going to make rocket boots instead), shoot and unlock a gravity gun type tool that starts off being able to push blocks and eventually upgrades to pull blocks too.

## The level structure and design
I’ll be making a larger post soon with all my blueprints and plans etc. but this is how I’m going to approach the design. <br>
I am using squared paper to plan the top and side of each sequence, as well as a set of node maps to show the flow of the level, a character sheet detailing the players abilities, and some sketches of rooms and such as an overview.

## Sourcing ideas
I wanted to do something a little different, all my peers are making a flat sci-fi puzzle game however I think that’s a bit dull and lifeless. As an avid horror fan I adore the ALIEN franchise as well as the original dead space, so instead of creating a time trailed puzzle game, I aim to make an atmospheric horror short with puzzle elements. 

So with this in mind I've collected some images, re-watched alien and YouTube’d a let’s play of dead space in order to a) get some ideas and b) get my mind in the zone.

{% capture images %} ../assets/img/space1.jpg ../assets/img/space2.jpg ../assets/img/space3.jpg ../assets/img/space4.jpg ../assets/img/space5.jpg ../assets/img/space6.jpg {% endcapture %} {% include gallery images=images caption="Some cool space images" cols=2 %}

Hope you enjoyed the update, will post my designs ASAP.
