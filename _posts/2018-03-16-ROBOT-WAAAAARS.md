# The final countdown
The end of this year is nigh and thus, the final project is upon us.
But this one isn't pass/fail like the rest, oh no, this beast is worth 60% of our final grade. The big cheese. <br>
Time to show ‘em what we've got.

## Synopsis
"Wait one second!", exclaimed Dave. "You know what would make this game totally awesome!! Networking!!!". The others in the group shot up like a pack of Meerkats. More than aware of his penchant for ambitious ideas, none of them were necessarily convinced it was a good idea. "It'll be a piece of cake" Dave explained, "A piece of cake".

## Getting stuck in
So yeah, networking, sounds like it's going to be fun. We've been tasked with recreating one of 2 games, X-COM: UFO Defence or Heroes of might and magic, and adding a networking component, allowing for LAN play.

We were given a brief of both games however I had already decided as soon as I heard the 2 games. XCOM is one of my favourite game series of all time. I own them all, I have played them all, I only have completed some of them.

XCOM is the ultimate alien invasion game. You are the commander of a secret task force, XCOM, who are earths last hope of defence against an impending invasion. Build your base, research new tech, shoot down UFO's and take the combat all the way back to mars!

As simple as possible, In XCOM's turn based combat, units have a set amount of time units. This directly relates to the amount of actions they can take per turn. Actions range from shooting (Aimed, snap shot and auto), moving, turning and changing stance.
Actions are heavily RNG based making every move a game of risk mitigation. Do you take a more accurate shot and kill that berserker? or should you get into better cover first?

When a unit is killed it is gone forever, making that sniper you've spent the last 10 hours training, oh so valuable. Combat is brutal, squads can be wiped in the blink of an eye and the base building is a resource management nightmare. This game is hard as nails.

## Bring on the robots
So I've actually forgotten what lead us to this decision but for this game, my new group and I, decided to run with the idea of turning it into a robot wars game and instead of base building we would feature full robot customization.

Now, there have been robot wars games in the past none of which have been turn based. And how does melee combat really work in a turn-based environment? **Cue chroma squad**.

Chroma squad is a tactical RPG in the vein of final fantasy tactics which I played recently as a part of my backlog busters. It’s a fantastic indie game and light on the wallet too. It has a heavy focus on melee combat and utilizes a unique teamwork mechanic which takes the strategy another layer deep.

Blending tactical RPG and XCOM style combat into a robot wars style game is sure to succeed, right?

More updates inbound, Easter can wait for all I care.
As always, thank you for reading and stay tuned for more!
