## About Me
Young and aspiring student with a passion for video games, currently studying Games Technology(Bsc) at The university of the west of england (Aka UWE) with a background in Computer Science, Information Technology and Physics.

I've always had a passion for computers, video games and programing and its been my dream for quite a while now to work as a part
of a development team, wether im programing or head of desing, as long as its not art related I really don't mind (I suck at drawing).

I also happen to blog, [stream games](www.twitch.tv/johnners007) and play the guitar, the more you know.
